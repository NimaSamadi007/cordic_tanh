# cordic_tanh
This is Tanh function implementation on hardware (FPGA), based on CORDIC algorithms.

The repository contains multiple directories. First directory is impl. This is where actual hardware (.v file) exists. Next directory is matlab which contains high-level implementation in Matlab. Finally the last directory is testbench which testbench itself and input data is provided.
